### IMPORTANT
This proyect is been changing to drift + riverpod / link will be posted here if you want look at it, and the most important part is the refactor of every widget, (been having a better impact in performace :D and also working with cupertinoscaffold for ios :)! and so the widgets can be tested more isolated (this time im including tests))

**WHY DRIFT?** The original project has been working with Sqlite directly that makes write extra code for models and providers, sqlite is more personalize but i dont want to put to much effor only for local db stuff, so drift make it easier and the most important the mistakes with the flow of saving the data is more readable, by the time this readme is wrote, drift is working perfect with riverpod I really like it. 

replicate proccessing in ios (trying new stuff):
